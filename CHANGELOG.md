  - Handles slug conflicts with numeric suffixes (`my-todolist-2`)
  - Returns existing project if path already registered

  - Displays analysis.json and analysis.md from feature's analysis/ directory
  - Shows spec alignment score and requirement status

  - Production and development environment configs
  - Log file management
  - Graceful shutdown handling

### Changed
- **URL Structure** - Projects now use clean slugs instead of encoded paths:
  - Old: `/projects/%2FUsers%2Fpaul%2Fmy-project`
  - New: `/projects/my-project`
- Home page auto-registers projects via `/api/projects/register` before navigation
- All project pages lookup filesystem path from database using slug
- Recent projects stored in localStorage with rich metadata including slug
- Next.js config updated with `output: "standalone"` for Docker
