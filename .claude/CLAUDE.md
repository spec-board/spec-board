# CLAUDE.md

Fast Apply: IMPORTANT: Use `edit_file` over `str_replace` or full file writes. It works with partial code snippets—no need for full file content.

Warp Grep: warp-grep is a subagent that takes in a search string and tries to find relevant context. Best practice is to use it at the beginning of codebase explorations to fast track finding relevant files/lines. Do not use it to pin point keywords, but use it for broader semantic queries. "Find the XYZ flow", "How does XYZ work", "Where is XYZ handled?", "Where is <error message> coming from?"

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

SoupSpec is a standalone, spec-driven framework for Claude Code. It provides a unified, optimized specification kit for AI-assisted development with 23 agents, 23 commands, 45 skills, and 8 behavioral modes.

## Response Format

At the end of every response, include a short summary in Vietnamese using this format:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tóm tắt: [Vietnamese summary here]              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Scope:** Specification files only (agents, commands, skills, workflows, modes, MCP configs). No CLI tools or runtime implementations.

**Note:** This spec references placeholder paths (`./agent-includes/specs/`, `./agent-includes/plans/`) that should be created in your project. See README.md for details.

## Development Commands

This is a specification-only project with no build system. There are no test, lint, or build commands.

**Validation:** Manually verify markdown syntax and YAML frontmatter in spec files.

## Collaboration Protocol

### Philosophy

Guide user to clarity through questions, not assumptions.

**Core principle:** When unclear, engage user's thinking rather than guess their intent.

### Approach

1. **Identify the gap** - What information is missing or ambiguous?
2. **Ask targeted questions** - Help user articulate the real need
3. **Reflect understanding** - "So you want X because Y?"
4. **Propose options** - "We could approach this by A, B, or C"
5. **Confirm direction** - Wait for explicit choice before acting

### Question Patterns

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Clarifying** | "What's the goal?" / "What's not working as expected?" |
| **Scoping** | "Should I modify existing X or create new Y?" |
| **Probing** | "Why do you need this?" / "What happens if we don't?" |
| **Option-presenting** | "Would you prefer approach A or B?" |
| **Constraint-checking** | "Are there limitations I should know about?" |

### Red Flags (Stop and Ask)

- Ambiguous pronouns without clear referent
- Multiple valid interpretations of request
- Inferring intent from indirect signals
- Creating something user didn't explicitly request
- Simplest reading seems incomplete or wrong

### Response Structure When Unclear

```
"I understand you want [what I heard].

However, I'm uncertain about [specific gap].

Could you clarify:
- [Specific question 1]
- [Specific question 2]

Or would you prefer I [option A] or [option B]?"
```

---

## Sub-Agent Delegation

### Delegation Principle

**Default behavior**: Prefer direct work for simple tasks. Delegate only when complexity warrants it.

**Threshold for delegation**: Task involves >3 files AND requires specialized expertise → CONSIDER sub-agent

### Decision Tree

```
User Request
    │
    ├─→ Simple task (<3 files, clear scope)? → Direct work (FIRST CHOICE)
    │
    ├─→ Complex task needing expertise? → Task tool (SECOND CHOICE)
    │
    ├─→ Skill exists for this pattern? → Skill tool (THIRD CHOICE)
    │
    └─→ Unsure? → Ask user for clarification
```

### Execution Mode Selection

**Default: Sequential execution** - Ensures close coordination and context sharing.

**Parallel execution ONLY when ALL conditions met:**
1. Tasks are truly independent (no shared files, no shared state)
2. 3+ distinct problem domains exist
3. Fixes are self-contained within boundaries
4. Results can be cleanly merged without conflicts
5. User explicitly requests parallel OR task clearly benefits

**Sequential is preferred when:**
- Output of one task informs another
- Investigation requires iterative discovery
- Shared understanding needed across tasks
- Changes touch overlapping code areas
- Coordination between changes is critical

### Parallel Execution Checklist

Before spawning parallel agents, verify:
- [ ] No shared files between tasks
- [ ] No shared state or dependencies
- [ ] Clear scope boundaries defined
- [ ] Conflict potential assessed as LOW
- [ ] Integration strategy planned

### Thoroughness Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `quick` | Basic search, 1-2 locations |
| `medium` | Multiple strategies, 3-5 locations (DEFAULT) |
| `very thorough` | Comprehensive analysis, all naming conventions |

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)

❌ Spawning parallel agents without verifying independence
❌ Delegating simple tasks that can be done directly
❌ Using parallel when sequential ensures better coordination
❌ Ignoring potential conflicts between parallel tasks
❌ Spawning agents "just in case" without clear need

---

## Multi-Agent Coordination

For complex tasks requiring multiple agents, use the **shared state document** `MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md`.

### Auto-Creation Rule

**IMPORTANT:** When starting a multi-agent task (using `/do`, `/parallel`, or orchestration mode), check if `MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md` exists in the working directory. If not, create it from the template below.

### When to Use

- Tasks involving 3+ agents
- Complex features requiring planning → research → implementation → testing → review
- Parallel execution with multiple agents
- Any task using `--mode=orchestration`

### Creating MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md

If the file doesn't exist, create it with this structure:

```markdown
# Multi-Agent Plan

> **Shared State Document** - This file is read and updated by multiple agents during task execution.
> Last updated by: `[agent-name]` at `[timestamp]`

<!-- CUSTOMIZATION POINT: Replace this section with your project architecture -->

**SoupSpec Structure** (this repository):
```
.claude/
├── agents/       # 22 specialized agent definitions (markdown)
├── commands/     # 20 slash command definitions (markdown)
├── modes/        # 7 behavioral mode configs (markdown)

- Skills: Reference docs + optional scripts, matched by description
- Modes: Adjust communication style and problem-solving approach

## Code Conventions

### Naming Conventions

| Type | Python | TypeScript/JavaScript |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| Files | `snake_case.py` | `kebab-case.ts` |
| Functions | `snake_case` | `camelCase` |
| Classes | `PascalCase` | `PascalCase` |
| Constants | `UPPER_SNAKE` | `UPPER_SNAKE` |
| Components | N/A | `PascalCase.tsx` |

### Code Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use type hints, docstrings for public APIs
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, no `any` types, use interfaces
- **JavaScript**: ESLint + Prettier, prefer `const` over `let`

### Formatters & Config Files

**IMPORTANT**: Before writing or editing code, check for and respect project formatter configurations.

#### Config File Priority

| Language | Config Files (check in order) |
|----------|------------------------------|
| JS/TS/Web | `.prettierrc`, `.prettierrc.json`, `.prettierrc.js`, `prettier.config.js` |
| Python | `pyproject.toml` (ruff/black section), `ruff.toml`, `.ruff.toml`, `setup.cfg` |
| Go | `gofmt` (no config, uses Go standard) |
| Rust | `rustfmt.toml`, `.rustfmt.toml` |

#### Required Behavior

1. **Check for existing config**: Before writing code, verify if formatter config exists in project root
2. **Follow project style**: Match existing code style in the file/project (indentation, quotes, semicolons)
3. **Use installed formatters**: The `format-code.cjs` PostToolUse hook auto-formats after Write/Edit, but you should still write well-formatted code
4. **Respect .editorconfig**: If present, follow its settings for indent style, line endings, etc.

#### Formatter Installation Check

Before writing code in a new project, verify formatters are available:

```bash
# JavaScript/TypeScript - check for prettier
ls node_modules/.bin/prettier 2>/dev/null || which prettier

# Python - check for ruff
which ruff

# Go - check for gofmt (comes with Go)
which gofmt

# Rust - check for rustfmt (comes with Rust)
which rustfmt
```

If formatters are missing, suggest installation:
- **Prettier**: `npm install -D prettier` or `pnpm add -D prettier`
- **Ruff**: `pip install ruff` or `uv pip install ruff`

### File Organization

- One component/class per file
- Group related files in feature directories
- Keep test files adjacent to source files or in `tests/` directory

---

## Behavioral Modes

Modes adjust communication style, output format, and problem-solving approach.

### Mode Activation

```bash
/mode-brainstorm              # Switch to brainstorm mode
/mode-save-money              # Switch to token-efficient mode
/do --mode=implementation     # Override for a single command
```

Mode files: `.claude/modes/`

---

## Command Flags

All commands support combinable flags for flexible customization.

### Universal Flags

| Flag | Description | Values |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `--mode=[mode]` | Behavioral mode | default, brainstorm, token-efficient, etc. |
| `--depth=[1-5]` | Thoroughness level | 1=quick, 5=exhaustive |
| `--format=[fmt]` | Output format | concise, detailed, json |
| `--save=[path]` | Save output to file | File path |
| `--checkpoint` | Create state checkpoint | Boolean |

### Persona Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--persona=security` | Security-focused analysis |
| `--persona=performance` | Performance-focused analysis |
| `--persona=architecture` | Architecture-focused analysis |

### Examples

```bash
/review --persona=security --depth=5 src/auth/
/chat --depth=5 --save=agent-includes/plans/design.md "feature"
/fix --format=concise "error message"
```

---

## Hooks

Reference: `.claude/hooks/`

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `blind.cjs` | Block access to heavy directories (node_modules, __pycache__, etc.) |
| `secrets-aware.cjs` | Detect and mask secrets in file operations (.env, credentials, API keys) |

Configuration: Add hooks to `.claude/settings.json`. See `.claude/hooks/README.md` for details.

## Engineering Principles

### Core Directive
Evidence > assumptions | Working code > documentation | Action > verbosity

### Design Patterns
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract shared logic into reusable functions/modules
- **KISS (Keep It Simple)**: Solve current problem, avoid premature optimization
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Build for current requirements, not hypothetical futures
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Prefer flexible composition to rigid class hierarchies

### SOLID Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Single Responsibility** | One clear purpose per function/class |
| **Open/Closed** | Extend via composition, not modification |
| **Liskov Substitution** | Subclasses honor parent contracts |
| **Interface Segregation** | Clients depend only on methods they use |
| **Dependency Inversion** | Depend on abstractions (interfaces) |

---

## Token Optimization

Control output verbosity for cost optimization.

| Level | Flag | Savings | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| Standard | (default) | 0% | Full explanations |
| Concise | `--format=concise` | 30-40% | Reduced explanations |
| Ultra | `--format=ultra` | 60-70% | Code-only responses |

### Session-Wide Optimization

```bash
/mode-save-money              # Activate token-efficient mode
```

---

## Context Management

### Codebase Exploration

```bash
/codebase                     # Index entire codebase → PROJECT_INDEX.md
/codebase src/api/            # Load specific area into context
/codebase "where is auth?"    # Search and answer questions
```

### Auto-Checkpoints

`/do` automatically creates checkpoints using git stash:

```bash
# Checkpoints created automatically at:
# - Before starting feature
# - After tests written
# - After implementation done

# To restore:
git stash list                # List checkpoints
git stash apply stash@{n}     # Restore specific checkpoint
```

### Parallel Tasks

```bash
/parallel "research auth patterns"
/parallel --list              # Check status
/parallel --collect           # Collect results
```
