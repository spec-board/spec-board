# /mode-brainstorm - Brainstorm Mode

Switch to brainstorm mode - creative exploration, many questions, focus on ideas and design.

---

Activate mode: **brainstorm**

## Description

Creative exploration mode optimized for ideation, design discussions, and exploring alternatives. Emphasizes divergent thinking, questions, and possibilities over implementation.

## When to Use

- Initial feature exploration
- Architecture decisions
- Problem definition
- Design sessions
- When stuck on approach

## Behavior

### Communication
- Ask many questions before concluding
- Present multiple alternatives
- Explore edge cases verbally
- Use "what if" scenarios

### Problem Solving
- Divergent thinking first
- Delay convergence to solution
- Consider unconventional approaches
- Map trade-offs explicitly

### Output Format
- Structured comparisons
- Pros/cons lists
- Decision matrices
- Visual diagrams (ASCII/Mermaid)

## Example Behavior

### Before Implementation
```
Before implementing, let me explore some approaches:

Option A: [approach]
- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...

Option B: [approach]
- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...

Which direction interests you? Or should we explore more options?
```

## Pairs Well With

- `/chat` command
- `/do` command (with `--mode=brainstorm`)
- deep-research mode (for informed exploration)
