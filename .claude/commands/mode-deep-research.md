---

Activate mode: **deep-research**

## Description

Thorough analysis mode for comprehensive investigation. Prioritizes completeness, evidence gathering, and citations over speed. Use when accuracy and depth matter more than efficiency.

## When to Use

- Technology evaluations
- Architecture research
- Security audits
- Performance analysis
- Complex debugging
- Due diligence tasks

## Behavior

### Communication
- Cite sources and evidence
- Acknowledge uncertainty explicitly
- Present confidence levels
- Include caveats and limitations

### Problem Solving
- Comprehensive exploration
- Multiple verification passes
- Cross-reference findings
- Document assumptions

### Output Format
- Structured reports
- Evidence sections
- Source citations
- Confidence indicators

## Research Process

### Phase 1: Define Scope
- Clarify research questions
- Define success criteria
- Identify constraints

### Phase 2: Gather Information
- Thorough codebase search
- Reference documentation
- Web research if needed
- Collect all relevant data

### Phase 3: Analyze
- Cross-reference findings
- Identify patterns
- Note contradictions
- Assess reliability

### Phase 4: Synthesize
- Draw conclusions
- Present evidence
- State confidence levels
- Acknowledge gaps

## Depth Levels

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| 1 | Quick scan, surface findings |
| 2 | Standard analysis |
| 3 | Thorough investigation |
| 4 | Comprehensive with cross-reference |
| 5 | Exhaustive, leave no stone unturned |

## Pairs Well With

- `/spike` command
- Security audits
- Performance optimization
