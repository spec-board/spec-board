## Findings Table

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| C1 | Constitution | ✅ PASS | plan.md:24-37 | All 6 constitution principles verified and documented | No action needed |
| A1 | Ambiguity | LOW | spec.md:125 | SC-001 "within 3 seconds" is subjective without automated measurement | Consider removing time-based criteria or adding test methodology |
| A2 | Ambiguity | LOW | spec.md:126 | SC-002 "within 5 seconds" same issue as A1 | Consider removing or defining measurement approach |
| U1 | Underspec | LOW | spec.md:86 | Edge case "column scrolls vertically" lacks max-height specification | Document expected scroll behavior or CSS constraints |
| U2 | Underspec | LOW | spec.md:87 | Edge case "truncated with ellipsis" lacks character limit | Document truncation threshold (e.g., 30 chars) |
| T1 | Terminology | MEDIUM | tasks.md:121 | Line reference "159-205" doesn't match actual code (screen reader summary at lines 231-235) | Update line number references to match current implementation |
| D1 | Duplication | LOW | spec.md:93-98, spec.md:26-30 | FR-002 duplicates US1 acceptance scenarios | Acceptable - FR provides normative spec, US provides testable scenarios |

## User Story Coverage

| User Story | Priority | Task Coverage | Status |
|------------|----------|---------------|--------|
| US1 - View Feature Pipeline | P1 | T010-T017 (8 tasks) | ✅ Complete |
| US2 - Track Task Progress | P2 | T018-T025 (8 tasks) | ✅ Complete |
| US3 - Access Feature Details | P3 | T026-T030 (5 tasks) | ✅ Complete |
| US4 - Navigate Board Accessibly | P4 | T031-T036 (6 tasks) | ✅ Complete |

## Constitution Alignment Issues

**None found.** All 6 principles are satisfied:

| Principle | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| I. Spec-Driven Visualization | ✅ | Read-only display of parsed features |
| II. Type Safety | ✅ | TypeScript strict mode, Feature type defined |
| III. Security First | ✅ | No user input, displays parsed data only |
| IV. Accessibility | ✅ | ARIA labels, keyboard nav, screen reader support |
| V. Clean URL Architecture | ✅ | Part of `/projects/{slug}` route |
| VI. Component Simplicity | ✅ | Single-responsibility components |

## Unmapped Tasks

| Task ID | Description | Issue |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| T001-T004 | Documentation verification | Setup phase - no direct FR mapping (acceptable) |
| T005-T009 | Code verification | Foundational phase - no direct FR mapping (acceptable) |
| T037 | CSS variables verification | Cross-cutting concern (acceptable) |
| T039-T041 | Polish tasks | Cross-cutting concern (acceptable) |

## Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Functional Requirements** | 12 |

| **Total Tasks** | 41 |
| **Requirements with ≥1 Task** | 11/12 (91.7%) |
| **User Story Coverage** | 4/4 (100%) |
| **Ambiguity Count** | 2 (LOW) |
| **Underspecification Count** | 2 (LOW) |
| **Duplication Count** | 1 (LOW, acceptable) |
| **Terminology Issues** | 1 (MEDIUM) |
| **Critical Issues** | 0 |
| **Constitution Violations** | 0 |

## Next Actions

✅ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION** - No critical issues found.

**Optional improvements** (LOW priority):

1. **FR-006 Coverage Gap**: Add explicit task to verify branch display on feature cards
   - Suggested: Add `T042 [US2] Verify branch name displays when feature.branch is set`

2. **Line Number Drift (T1)**: Update tasks.md line references to match current code
   - T031 references lines 159-205, but screen reader summary is at lines 231-235

3. **Success Criteria Measurability (A1, A2)**: Consider removing time-based criteria or documenting test methodology

**Proceed with confidence** - The specification is well-structured with:
- 100% user story coverage
- 91.7% functional requirement coverage
- Zero constitution violations
- All tasks completed and verified
